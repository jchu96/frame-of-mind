# Work Log

## 2026-07-25

- Scaffolded the TypeScript CLI, Bluedot OAuth/MCP adapter, Gemini two-pass Files API analysis, secure download path, screenshots, durable JSON/Markdown artifacts, tests, CI, agent guidance, and runbook.
- Verified `gemini-3.6-flash` against an 8:54 local screen recording and deleted the remote Gemini file after analysis.
- Confirmed a live Bluedot output-schema mismatch and the absence of a recording URL; documented both.
- Added Granola MCP and local-file context adapters.
- Added explicit/model-derived transcript alignment after a source clip was found to begin later than the full meeting transcript.
- Added self-contained `report.html` as an optional artifact-like review surface while retaining JSON as the source of truth.
- Used a short authorized screen recording to validate issue-review output and a downstream ticket workflow.
- Reframed the product from evidence dossiers to recipe-driven video understanding and selected the public Frame of Mind brand.
- Added built-in recipes, general `analysis.json`, architecture/credentials/recipes/versioning docs, and a Codex/Claude skill installer.
- Added explicit Granola REST API-key transport while retaining MCP OAuth as the default.
- Added a Bun/Nuxt UI SSR review workspace with explicit imports, local SQLite,
  Cloudflare D1, build-time adapter selection, and Access JWT enforcement.
- Documented the deferred read-only local/Cloudflare MCP design using the NEC
  Knowledge Base's shared-core and dual-front-door pattern.
- Ran independent adversarial security, provider, and contract reviews; closed
  findings across OAuth recovery, MCP error handling, transcript isolation,
  path safety, media limits, import streaming, contract parity, and D1
  retention.
- Reproduced and fixed a clean Linux CI failure caused by an undeclared
  Tailwind workspace dependency, then validated a fresh frozen Bun install.

## 2026-07-26

- Completed the v0.2 adversarial hardening pass: exact-resource OAuth
  isolation, v2 run/digest/recipe provenance, strict evidence timestamps,
  caption normalization, bounded Granola streaming, cleanup retries, CSRF
  controls, keyset pagination, and D1 bulk item expansion.
- Added and adversarially reviewed the public local Studio Conductor track.
  Grounded five architecture blockers and two plan gaps, then revised job/media
  authority, local session security, retention/reattachment, provider
  capabilities, Worker isolation, delivery slices, rollback, and risk gates.
- Added the canonical ADR index and ADRs 0006-0008 for local Studio execution,
  lifecycle separation, and environment/session-only API secrets.
- Implemented the first four local Studio foundation tasks and measured a
  synthetic 32 MiB Bun/Nitro stream through bounded `FileSink` writes, atomic
  seal, byte ranges, and Cloudflare build-time exclusion.
- Added the local Studio one-time launch exchange: a URL-fragment capability is
  removed before a bounded same-origin POST creates an HttpOnly, SameSite
  Strict process-session cookie; Cloudflare builds exclude the complete route,
  plugin, and session implementation.
- Completed local Studio connection health: `.env`-first and process-memory
  API keys, exact-resource Bluedot/Granola OAuth status/initiation, a
  session-protected Nuxt Connections page, and a production Bun launcher bound
  explicitly to `127.0.0.1`. Browser validation caught and closed Node-dev,
  all-interface binding, and first-load cookie-race failures.
- Added scoped Conductor and shared-web contract guidance, then fixed the Phase
  3 Nuxt UI boundary: `UFileUpload` owns accessible selection while a separate
  composable and the server media-session contract own resumable staging,
  reconciliation, progress, cancellation, and cleanup.
- Added an isolated Playwright Studio baseline covering browser bootstrap,
  session denial/replay, temporary-key nonreflection, synthetic import/review,
  console cleanliness, and narrow-screen overflow. The test server clears
  provider credentials and uses temporary OAuth, SQLite, and dotenv state.

## 2026-07-27

- Adversarially reviewed the Playwright baseline and fixed a real replay
  hydration race, retry false-green policy, non-idempotent secret precondition,
  process/browser dotenv exposure, and forceful-shutdown temp leak. CI now
  fails flaky tests, provider canaries prove isolation, and the outer runner
  cleans its synthetic database after both success and failure.
- Implemented the Phase 3 local media backend: private resumable staging,
  durable part receipts, replay/conflict checks, streamed seal verification,
  explicit retention/expiry, retryable cleanup, startup reconciliation, and
  authenticated local-only HTTP routes. Adapter, production-built HTTP, and
  Cloudflare-exclusion coverage use only synthetic bytes.
- The adversarial pass closed canonical-root symlink escape, receipt
  check/open replacement, stale-upload mutation, and contradictory
  partial-plus-sealed restart cases. Full repository checks and five
  production Playwright smoke journeys passed afterward.
- Added the accessible local Recording page with explicit retention and remote
  transfer disclosure, browser-side validation, receipt-confirmed progress,
  pause/retry/abort, and hash-verified refresh resume. Deterministic client
  tests and production Playwright cover small-file stage/delete and an
  8 MiB confirmed-part resume; the browser pass also caught and fixed deleted
  terminal-state handling and mobile header overflow.
- Adversarially reviewed the Recording slice and closed sealed-media orphaning,
  seal/delete concurrency, replacement-handle loss, ambiguous create
  duplication, storage-denial, incomplete identity verification, rounded
  progress, and missing controller/drop/keyboard coverage. The client now
  verifies a complete bounded-part fingerprint, the server owns every expiry,
  and focused state-machine plus production-browser tests cover the repaired
  seams.
- Closed the follow-up retention seam by adding a non-overlapping,
  lifecycle-owned media expiry sweep with shared writer ownership, cleanup
  retry, sanitized failure reporting, and deterministic shutdown tests.

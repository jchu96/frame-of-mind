# Work Log

## 2026-07-25

- Scaffolded the TypeScript CLI, Bluedot OAuth/MCP adapter, Gemini two-pass Files API analysis, secure download path, screenshots, durable JSON/Markdown artifacts, tests, CI, agent guidance, and runbook.
- Verified `gemini-3.6-flash` against an 8:54 local screen recording and deleted the remote Gemini file after analysis.
- Confirmed a live Bluedot output-schema mismatch and the absence of a recording URL; documented both.
- Added Granola MCP and local-file context adapters.
- Added explicit/model-derived transcript alignment after a source clip was found to begin later than the full meeting transcript.
- Added self-contained `report.html` as an optional artifact-like review surface while retaining JSON as the source of truth.
- Used a short authorized screen recording to validate issue-review output and a downstream ticket workflow.
- Reframed the product from evidence dossiers to recipe-driven video understanding and selected the public Frame of Mind brand.
- Added built-in recipes, general `analysis.json`, architecture/credentials/recipes/versioning docs, and a Codex/Claude skill installer.
- Added explicit Granola REST API-key transport while retaining MCP OAuth as the default.
- Added a Bun/Nuxt UI SSR review workspace with explicit imports, local SQLite,
  Cloudflare D1, build-time adapter selection, and Access JWT enforcement.
- Documented the deferred read-only local/Cloudflare MCP design using the NEC
  Knowledge Base's shared-core and dual-front-door pattern.
- Ran independent adversarial security, provider, and contract reviews; closed
  findings across OAuth recovery, MCP error handling, transcript isolation,
  path safety, media limits, import streaming, contract parity, and D1
  retention.
- Reproduced and fixed a clean Linux CI failure caused by an undeclared
  Tailwind workspace dependency, then validated a fresh frozen Bun install.
